# Build an Automated Landing Page using AI from Wix ADI

## Project Overview

In this project, you will learn how to design a lead generation landing page with a free ebook lead magnet to collect email addresses using Wix Artificial Design Intelligence. You will then use the Email Automation feature from Wix to send an automated email with an option to download the free ebook and a Call to Action to join a webinar where you, as a marketer, can then sell premium products. This lead generation strategy is highly effective with really high conversion rates if done right. By the end of this project, you will have a high-converting automated landing page, which you can post on your YouTube channel, Facebook groups, LinkedIn page, or boost it through Facebook ads.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to build an automated landing page using AI from Wix ADI as part of a hands-on guided project issued by Coursera. The project involved creating a website, customizing it with relevant fields, and setting up a lead generation landing page. This landing page is designed to collect email addresses using Wix Artificial Design Intelligence, and it is integrated with an automated email system and a Call to Action (CTA) to join a webinar.

## Project Structure

The project can be categorized into the following phases:

1. **Account Setup**: Create a Wix account and familiarize yourself with the platform.
2. **AI-Driven Design**: Utilize Wix ADI to create and customize the landing page.
3. **Lead Generation**: Implement lead magnets to capture email addresses.
4. **Email Automation**: Set up automated emails to engage leads and provide a CTA to join a webinar.
5. **Testing**: Conduct tests to ensure the landing page and email automation are functioning correctly.

This project follows a **modular architecture** where each component, such as landing page design, email automation, and CTA integration, operates independently but cohesively to achieve the overall goal.
